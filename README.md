# small-ai-projects

Projects developed for the subject Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - 2/2021.
In this course, the following algorithms were implemented:

1. Greedy Search - `busca/busca_gulosa.py`
2. Uniform Cost Search - `busca/busca_custo_uniforme.py`
3. A* Search - `busca/busca_a_estrela.py`
4. Minimax - `busca/min-max.py`
5. Alpha-Beta Pruning - `busca/alpha-beta.py`
6. Perceptron - `perceptron/perceptron.ipynb`

### Getting started

To run any of these algorithms, you will need `Python>=3.8`. To run and interact with the perceptron project, a notebook plaform is required (ex: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc)

All the search algorithms can be exectued by:

```
python3 path
```
